Chaos Keys

Web Game made with Javascript HTML and CSS

You have 60 seconds to type the words that pop up on the screen as fast as you can if the words touch the bottom you lose.

The words are separated into three columns and you have a red dot to pick a column and type that word

And you can switch to other columns using arrow keys to type the words that pop up in those columns.

the difficulty of the game is that the interval of the words pop up are random and you can get big words

The main goal is to type as many words as you can while you can only type in only one column and not let any words touch the bottom.

We added a leaderboard and score counter for details.

Some troubles we came across was aligning the both the game box and leaderboard box because it adjust based on aspect ratio

And the order of the Arrays, getting the words to start from the top and the first word heading towards the red dot.
